            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I began my career as a software developer, where I gained a deep understanding of how products are built. Over time, I transitioned into product management, driven by my passion for aligning technology with business strategy. With experience at companies like Bank of America and TVS Group, I've led cross-functional teams through product lifecycles, from ideation to launch. My expertise spans Agile methodologies, data-driven decision-making, and UI/UX design, all aimed at delivering products that solve real-world problems. One of my most significant challenges involved leading a product overhaul mid-development, which taught me the value of adaptability and clear communication. I am motivated by problem-solving and continuous learning, always striving to build products that bring value to both users and businesses.</p>
